# Hunt
Simulation of a hunting using p5 and python using boids. The original inspiration is to create a machine learning framework that enables predators to catch its pray. To start, i created a python script using p5 to create a hunting ground. Later on this can be used to obtain necessary datapoints for a deep learning / neuro evloution framework.

##Changes

included primitive scoring mechanism based upon the number of captured food with respect to time. 

## contributing

Any optimization is welcome. This is my first attempt here at github.
